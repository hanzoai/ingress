# Thank You!

_You_ Made It
{: .subtitle}

Hanzo Ingress truly is an [open-source project](https://github.com/hanzoai/ingress/),
and wouldn't have become what it is today without the help of our [many contributors](https://github.com/hanzoai/ingress/graphs/contributors),
not accounting for people having helped with issues, tests, comments, articles, ... or just enjoy using Hanzo Ingress and share with others.

So once again, thank you for your invaluable help in making Hanzo Ingress such a good product!
